This is a Architect Website designed by using HTML and CSS.
I made and designed this website alone on 7/03/24 and started this project two or three days before.
On many steps I faced challenges like how to insert text on image section and on some styling process.
Many things I have learned from one of the course on Udemy from Jonas Schmedtmann and he is really a great teacher.
